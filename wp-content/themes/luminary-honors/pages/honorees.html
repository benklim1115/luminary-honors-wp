                    <p>Joe R. Long with his beloved wife Teresa Lozano Long who passed in 2021, gave their
                        initial gift of $1 million to UT Health San Antonio in 1999 to support scholarships for medical
                        students from South Texas. A transformative $25 million gift in 2008 expanded scholarships for
                        studenst studying to be physicians, nurses, physician assistants and scientists. The Austin
                        couple, who were married for 63 years and considered the Long Scholars their children, have
                        contributed more than $70 million to UT Health to advance the future of health. Their legacy of
                        giving resuted in the naming of main campus and the renaming of the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano
                        Long School of Medicine.</p>

                    <p>Community leaders and philanthropists Margie and Bill Klesse are true examples of what it means
                        to care about your community. Bill is the former Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer
                        and President of Valero Energy Corporation. At Valero, he was the chief proponent of
                        volunteerism by encouraging employees to return the blessings they were enjoying. Margie has
                        served on various community boards including the Mays Cancer Center Board of Governors, the
                        Library Foundation, the Catholic Community Foundation, and the Ecumenical Council. Together, the
                        couple established the Klesse Foundation to give even more back to the community. It has
                        supported many worthy causes including the innovative work being performed in UT Health’s Mays
                        Cancer Center, Greehey Children’s Cancer Research Institute and Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s
                        and Neurodegenerative Diseases as well as being the largest supporter of the new UT Health San
                        Antonio Multispecialty and Research Hospital. Fueled by our commitment to excellence and
                        discovery, this patient-centered hospital will deliver a singular healing advantage for the
                        people of South Texas, ushering in a game-changing, fundamental shift to proactive, personalized
                        medicine and could not have been possible without dedicated supporters like Margie and Bill.</p>

                    <p>Since its founding almost 50 years ago, UT Health San Antonio’s Mays Cancer Center has grown in
                        stature, scope, funding, patient care and research. But there’s been at least one constant: the
                        support of the Mays Family and the Mays Family Foundation. The Mays Family has long been
                        involved in the effort to make the Mays Cancer Center the premier cancer treatment and research
                        center in South Texas. As President of the Mays Family Foundation, Kathy Mays Johnson is
                        carrying on her family’s legacy of giving back to the community. With grandparents and parents
                        who believed in supporting worthy causes that aid, empower, enrich and educate, Kathy has been a
                        longtime supporter of the Mays Cancer Center, which was renamed in 2018 in honor of her family
                        and the Mays Family Foundation’s gifts of more than $50 million in the fight against cancer.
                        Kathy and her parents, Lowry and Peggy Mays (who passed in 2022 and 2020 respectively), all
                        battled cancer and were devoted to ensuring others can receive cancer treatment close to home.
